            Hello! My name is <strong>Xuelan Lin</strong>. I'm originally from China and have been living in Canada for the past three years. During my time here, I gained valuable experience through various entry-level positions, which greatly enhanced my work ethic, communication skills, and adaptability.

            <br /><br />
            
            My journey into the world of technology began with a strong passion for problem-solving, which led me to pursue the Computer Systems Technology program. Despite its challenges, I remained determined and forged lasting friendships that supported me throughout this demanding program.
            Throughout my studies at BCIT, I had the opportunity to engage in fascinating projects. Notably, I contributed to the development of the RENR Safety App and MyMind, projects that garnered recognition from my colleagues, instructors, and clients alike.

            <br /><br />

              Working collaboratively within a team towards a shared objective has been an incredibly rewarding and unique experience for me. I am eager to continue exploring exciting projects in the future, with a particular interest in web development and cross-platform mobile development.
